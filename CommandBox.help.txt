# This is the Command Box file for ARSSE
#
# The commands are loaded from this file to the Command Box
# You can add your own commands to this list.
# You can do this by the following sytnax:
#
# Command Name
# {			(this is the opening bracket, it's a must)
# /soldatcommand1	(this is a soldat command. you can use any)
# }			(closing bracket, this is a must)
#
# Lines starting with # are comments, and left out from parsing.
# There are built-in functions, which will help you make your
# commands more flexible, more custom. These are the following:
#
# $INPUT('Caption','Question')
# $CONFIRM('Question')
# $TOGGLE('Caption','Question')
# $TEAMSELECT
# $JOINSOLDAT
#
#
# $INPUT() will ask for a specific input. You can set the window
# caption and the Question to ask. You can use it anywhere
# in your command.
# You must use the above syntax. You must make sure that it
# ends with ') otherwise it will fail to work.
# The following examples show you how to use it:
#
# Correct:
#
# /say $INPUT ( 'Server Message' , 'What do you want to say?')
#
# WRONG:
#
# /say $INPUT ( 'Server Message' , 'What do you want to say?'  )
#
# Notice that the only difference is at the end.
#
# $INPUT can have the following addons at it's end:
#
# :$LOADBOTS
#
# This will open a window with the default Bot names (check botlist.txt)
#
# :$LOADMAPS
#
# This will open a window with the default maps (check maplist.txt)
# It will show only maps for the current game mode
#
# :$LOADBANS
#
# This will open a window with the banned names' list (if any)
# Actually it is the contents of bannames.txt
#
# You can use these addons with $INPUT() only in the syntax below:
#
# $INPUT('Caption','Question'):$LOADXXX
#
#
# $CONFIRM() will ask you a question, if you press Ok, the commands
# after it will be executed, if you press Cancel, the command will abort.
# The syntax is pretty much the same as $INPUT().
#
# $TOGGLE() asks you a question with buttons 'On' and 'Off'. If you press
# 'On', it will insert a 1, if you press 'Off', it will insert 0 where
# $TOGGLE() is. You can alternatively press Cancel to abort the command.
#
# $TEAMSELECT will let you select a team, and insert the team number in
# place of the function. It acts different in each gamemode:
# In DM, PM, RM it doesn't show at all
# In CTF, INF and HTF it lets you select Alpha and Bravo
# In TM it lets you select all teams (except Spectator)
#
# $JOINSOLDAT simply starts Soldat and joins the actual server.
# Soldat must be properly installed for this to work.
# (it uses the soldat://server:port method to run Soldat)
